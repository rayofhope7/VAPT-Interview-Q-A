- The priority of any incident response is to protect life, health, and safety. When any decision related to priorities is to be made, always choose safety first.
- The primary goal of incident management is to be prepared. Preparation requires having a policy and a response plan that will lead the organization through the crisis. 
  Some organizations use the term “crisis management” to describe this process
- An event is any measurable occurrence, and most events are harmless. However, if the event has the potential to disrupt the business’s mission, then it is called an incident. 
  Every organization must have an incident response plan that will help preserve business viability and survival.
- The incident response process is aimed at reducing the impact of an incident so the organization can resume the interrupted operations as soon as possible. 
  Incident response planning is a subset of the greater discipline of business continuity management (BCM).

Single-factor authentication: -
    - Use of just one of the three available factors (something you know, something you have, something you are) to carry out the authentication process being requested

Multi-factor authentication: -
    - Use of two or more distinct instances of the three factors of authentication (something you know, something you have, something you are) for identity verification.

Common best practice is to implement at least two of the three common techniques for authentication:

- Knowledge-based
- Token-based
- Characteristic-based
- Knowledge-based authentication uses a passphrase or secret code to differentiate between an authorized and unauthorized user. 
  If you have selected a personal identification number (PIN), created a password, or entered some other secret value that only you know, then you have experienced knowledge-based authentication
- The problem with using this type of authentication alone is that it is often vulnerable to a variety of attacks. For example, the help desk might receive a call to reset a userâ€™s password. 
  The challenge is ensuring that the password is reset only for the correct user and not someone else pretending to be that user. For better security, a second or third form of authentication 
  that is based on a token or characteristic would be required prior to resetting the password. 
  The combined use of a user ID and a password consists of two things that are known, and because it does not meet the requirement of using two or more of the authentication methods stated, it is not considered MFA

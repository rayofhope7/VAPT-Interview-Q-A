- The analysis performed as part of risk management. A risk assessments incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses and considers mitigations provided by security controls planned or in place.
- Risk assessment is defined as the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks to an organization’s operations (including its mission, functions, image, and reputation), assets, individuals, 
  other organizations, and even the nation.
- A common risk assessment activity identifies the risk of fire to a building. While there are many ways to mitigate that risk, the primary goal of a risk assessment is to estimate and prioritize. 
  For example, fire alarms are the lowest cost and can alert personnel to evacuate and reduce the risk of personal injury, but they won’t keep a fire from spreading or causing more damage. 
  Sprinkler systems won’t prevent a fire but can minimize the amount of damage done. However, while sprinklers in a data center limit the fire’s spread, it is likely they will destroy all the systems and data on them.
- A gas-based system may be the best solution to protect the systems, but it might be cost-prohibitive. A risk assessment can prioritize these items for management to determine the method of mitigation that best 
  suits the assets being protected.
- The result of the risk assessment process is often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s). 
  This report is provided to management for review and approval.

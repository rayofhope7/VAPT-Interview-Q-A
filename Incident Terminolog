- While security professionals strive to protect systems from malicious attacks or human carelessness, inevitably, things go wrong. For this reason, security professionals also play the role of first responders. 
  An understanding of incident response starts with knowing the terms used to describe various cyberattacks.

Breach: -
  - The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where: a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses 
    personally identifiable information; or an authorized user accesses personally identifiable information for other than an authorized purpose. NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5

Event: -
    - Any observable occurrence in a network or system. NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2

Exploit: -
    - A particular attack. It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilitis.

Incident: -
    - An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits.

Intrusion: -
    - A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization. 
      IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2

Threat: -
    - Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, 
      or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/ or denial of service. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1.

Vulnerability: -
    - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

Zero Day: -
    - A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures, or methods.

The purpose of implementing security controls in the risk management process is to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.

Explanation:

- Mitigating risk: Involves applying security measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of potential threats to an acceptable level, balancing the costs and benefits of those measures.

The other options are not accurate:

- To increase the level of risk: This is contrary to the purpose of security controls.
- To ensure a cyberattack would be impossible: While security controls reduce risk, they cannot guarantee absolute security.
- To eliminate all vulnerabilities: Eliminating all vulnerabilities is typically impractical; instead, the goal is to manage and mitigate them effectively.

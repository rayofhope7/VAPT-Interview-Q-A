When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. 
Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures.

How are regulations, standards, policies, and procedures related? It might help to look at the list in reverse.

  - Procedures are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.
  - Policies are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations.
  - Standards are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.
  - Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for non-compliance.

Regulations and Law: -
  - Regulations and associated fines and penalties can be imposed by governments at the national, regional, or local level.
  - It is common to be subject to regulation on several levels. Multinational organizations are subject to regulations in more than one nation in addition to multiple regions and municipalities. Organizations need to consider the regulations that apply to their business at all levels—national, regional, and local—and ensure they are compliant with the most restrictive regulation

Standards: -
  - Organizations use multiple standards as part of their information systems security programs, both as compliance documents and as advisories or guideline.
  - Standards cover a broad range of issues and ideas and may provide assurance that an organization is operating with policies and procedures that support regulations and widely accepted best practice.
  - Finally, think about how computers talk to other computers across the globe. People speak different languages and do not always understand each other. How are computers able to communicate? Through standards, of course.
  - Thanks to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), there are standards in communication protocols that ensure all computers can connect with each other across borders, even when the operators do not speak the same language

Policies: -
  - Policy is informed by applicable law(s) and specifies which standards and guidelines the organization will follow. 
    Policy is broad but not detailed; it establishes context and sets out strategic direction and priorities. Governance policies are used to moderate and control decision- making, to ensure compliance when necessary, and to guide the creation and implementation of other policies.
  - Policies are often written at many levels across the organization. High- level governance policies are used by senior executives to shape and control decision-making processes.
  - Other high-level policies direct the behavior and activity of the entire organization as it moves toward goals and objectives. Functional areas such as human resources management, finance and accounting, and security and asset protection usually have their own sets of policies. 
    Whether imposed by laws and regulations or by contracts, the need for compliance might also require the development of specific high-level policies that are documented and assessed for their effective use by the organization.
  - Policies are implemented, or carried out, by people; for that, someone must expand the policies from statements of intent and direction into step-by- step instructions, or procedures.

Procedures: -
  - Procedures define the explicit, repeatable activities necessary to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks. They provide supporting data, decision criteria, or other explicit knowledge needed to perform each task. 
    Procedures can address one-time or infrequent actions or common, regular occurrences.
  - In addition, procedures establish the measurement criteria and methods to use to determine whether a task has been successfully completed. 
    Properly documenting procedures and training personnel on how to locate and follow them is necessary for deriving the maximum organizational benefits from procedure
